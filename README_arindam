How to change the range of m_state??

1. Initialize state_max to something (odd)
2. Initialize m_state, m_state_plus and m_state_minus arrays to state_max/2 (near line 157)


Phase length 4k with state_max = 7 is giving best results


How to change from dcnt to daaip based deadblock prediction??

1. change in migrate() function (near line 1025)


For changing cache size:

1.gainestown_10 = 8MB sttram llc, with phc
2.gainestown_11 = 4MB sttram llc, with phc
3.gainestown_12 = 16MB sttram llc, with phc
4.gainestown_13 = 4MB lru sttram llc
5.gainestown_14 = 8MB lru sttram llc
6.gainestown_15 = 16MB lru sttram llc
7.gainestown_1 = 2MB lru sttam llc

How to change from Hybrid to STTRAM?

1. In cache_cntlr.cc change #define WAYS_TO_SRAM to 0
2. In phc.cc, change SRAM_ways to 0


How to change to Hybrid?

1. In cache_cntlr.cc change #define WAYS_TO_SRAM to 4
2. In phc.cc, change SRAM_ways to 4


Hoe to change to SRAM?

1. In cache_cntlr.cc change #define WAYS_TO_SRAM to 16
2. In phc.cc, change SRAM_ways to 16


While comparing lru and phc, only the following benchmarks (13) show variation:

While comparing different variations of phc, following benchmarks (10) show variation:

if(m_wcnt[m_TI[index]] != 0)
            m_wcnt[m_TI[index]]--;  //decrement write burst counter on eviction

migrate: during eviction from sram, if the evicted block is live, preserve it in sttram. Used 5 times. (getReplacementIndex: set index=1,2,3,4 and nonsampler sets)

migrate2: during core-write(writeback) to sttram, if the block is write burst, swap it with a block from sram. Uses write burst predictor 

migrate_during_write: during write (both core-write and demand write) to sttram, if the block is found to be write intense, swap it with ablock from SRAM. Uses read-write intensity predictor of baseline phc. Used 4 times (getReplacementIndex: set index=3,4,nonsampler sets; updateReplacementIndex2)
